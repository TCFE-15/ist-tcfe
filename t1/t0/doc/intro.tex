\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}


For this laboratory assignment, our objective was to study a circuit containing multiple components, such as resistors, independent voltage and current sources, $V_a$ and  $I_d$, respectively, a current dependent voltage source, $V_c$, and a voltage dependent current source, $I_b$, using a structured approach, as explained in the theory classes.
This circuit is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we present an analysis of the circuit following two different methods: the Mesh Method, in Section~\ref{sec:mesh}, and the nodal method in Section~\ref{sec:nodal}. 
In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, we run a simulation of the circuit, using NGSpice, whose results are then compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. Finally, the conclusions of this study are presented in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
